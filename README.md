# Piiper
This project is in tandem with the efforts of [Open Learning Exchange](https://ole.org) in setting up the RaspberryPi server via USB tethering from and Android device. It is but one leg on the greater project which will be [here](https://github.com/kylemathias/Mobile-Team-Projects).

[Current documentation](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/take-home/issues/66) until it gets added here verbosely.


## Goals
- Obtain IP address of the RaspberryPi
- Connect automatically to it with the push of a button via SSH
- Automate prescripted SSH commands to complete setup process
